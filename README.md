# Recursion-Algorithm

### This task required writing a script that enables you to check for palindrome strings.

#### Palindrome is a string that’s spelled the same when read forward and backward. Some palindrome strings are as follows:
“nope” spelled backwards is “epon”, so it’s not a palindrome
“civic” spelled backwards is also “civic”, so it’s a palindrome
